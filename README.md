# NetLogo model of a stock market - Master Thesis - Nick van Berkel
NetLogo model of a stock market for my Master Thesis. This agent-based model of a stock market simulates individual investors and non-financial, public firms. Investors (or shareholders) trade shares based on either a fundamentalist and chartist investing strategy and alter their price forecasts based on the accuracy of the investing strategy in the past. They also change their investing strategy based on the return on investment of the investors in their direct environment. Non-financial firms (NFCs) payout dividend, repurchase shares and invest their capital with their annual earnings. They change their dividend rate, share repurchasing target and investment decisions based on three strategies that either tries to maximize the shareholder value, minimize their interest payments or keep a minimum payout and investment ratio.
